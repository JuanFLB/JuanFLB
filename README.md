- 👋 Hi, I’m @JuanFLB
- 👀 I’m interested in R, data visualization and its application to basic science (specifically liver cancer).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and all the nice things about the tidyverse package.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data visualization projects and analysis of clinical data.
- 📫 My twitter is @JuanLB_PhD and I am sure my mail is here somewhere... :)
